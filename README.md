# Donate: Reducing Waste, Supporting Communities

Donate is an Android app designed to help reduce waste by allowing users to donate unused items and support those in need. Whether it's food, clothing, or furniture, users can easily post available items they wish to give away, and those in need can claim them. The app facilitates communication between donors and receivers to ensure smooth exchanges.

Developed with Android Studio, Java, and XML, and powered by Firebase for real-time data storage and user authentication, Donate aims to build a connected, sustainable community while minimizing waste.
